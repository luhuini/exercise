				<h1>Cat House</h1>
				<p id="blue">According to National Geographic, cats first started hanging around human settlements and eating the rodents that threatened our grain stores as early as eight thousand years ago. It wasn't until the nineteenth century, however, that cat fanciers started breeding cats deliberately for a specific appearance or demeanor. A select few cats, such as the Egyptian Mau, still resemble their wild ancestors from the deserts of the Middle East (or in the case of the Maine Coon, snowy North America). The rest are the result of human tinkering with one of nature's most purr-fect animal companions.</p>
				<p id="green">Unlike dogs, cats have changed very little genetically from the wild cats that first hung around our ancient farms. Since cats were never bred for specific hunting or herding tasks the way dogs were, their variations are more subtle than, say, the difference between a Rottweiler and a beagle.</p>
